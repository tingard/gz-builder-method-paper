# Galaxy Zoo builder method paper

Paper can be found [here](https://github.com/tingard/gz-builder-method-paper/blob/master/main.pdf).

I personally work in Atom with the [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex) and [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex) packages, though I would understand why that is not an ideal situation for some.

I'd like to integrate overleaf but I'm not sure how best to go about it.
