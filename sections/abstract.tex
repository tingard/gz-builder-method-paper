The value of citizen science to obtain classifications of galaxy morphology on a large scale has been widely demonstrated in the literature, however such morphologies can lack the quantitative power obtained through the fitting of photometric profiles. This paper presents a novel interface, built inside the Zooniverse citizen science platform, which enables users to create detailed photometric models of galaxies from r-band SDSS images. We examine the resilience of this method, compare it to more traditional automated fitting pipelines, and perform preliminary investigation into the validity and usefulness of the classifications obtained.
