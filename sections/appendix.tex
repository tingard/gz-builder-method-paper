% \section{Technical overview of the Zooniverse project}
%
% The custom code allowing in-browser galaxy photometric modelling had to be incorporated into the existing Zooniverse website front-end codebase\footnote{\url{http://github.com/zooniverse/Panoptes-Front-End}}. This front-end was written using Facebook's \textsc{React}\footnote{\url{http://reactjs.org}} JavaScript library, which uses a declarative, component-based framework to piece together an interactive webpage from a series of building blocks.
%
% Traditionally the way Zooniverse projects operate is fairly linear - with researchers uploading data, generally in the form of one or more images. These ``subjects`` are then presented to volunteers, who are asked to perform a series of relatively simple tasks to extract meaningful information useful to the project's science case. Exceptions to this workflow exist, such as the Galaxy Zoo mergers project \citep{Holincheck2016:1604.00435v1}, but not inside the current Zooniverse web platform.
%
% The Galaxy Builder project breaks the above pattern in that two of the images a volunteer is shown vary depending on their in-progress classification. This seemingly small change results in a significant amount of code restructuring, which was not anticipated at the onset of the project.
%
% Initially, rendering was performed on the CPU, simply using JavaScript. As JavaScript compilers have become increasingly advanced (approaching numpy-level speeds for many mathematical tasks), this option seemed viable for some time. However, the requirement of a smooth user-interface and near-instantaneous feedback on changes for volunteer prompted a change to GPU rendering using WebGL. For convenience, the \textsc{regl}\footnote{\url{http://regl.party/}} package was selected for use.

\section{Mathematical description of the poly-line separation measure}
\label{appendix:clusteringMaths}

This appendix details the metric used in Section \ref{sec:aggregation_of_volunteer_models} to cluster poly\-lines used by volunteers to model spirals arms. It can be seen as a variant of the Fr√©chet distance.

First, define a poly-line containing $n$ 2D cartesian coordinates (vertices) as

\begin{equation}
A: \{i \in \mathbb{N};\;i<n\} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
^2\end{equation}

We also define a function, $t$, which calculates how far a point $\vec{p}$ is along the line between two other points ($\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$):

\begin{equation}
t(\vec{p},\,\vec{v},\,\vec{w}) \equiv \frac{(\vec{p} - \vec{v})\cdot(\vec{v} - \vec{w})}{|\vec{w} - \vec{v}|^2}.
\end{equation}

The minimum distance from $\vec{p}$ to the line segment between $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
d(\vec{p},\,\vec{v},\,\vec{w}) = \|\left(\vec{v} + \mathrm{min}(\mathrm{max}(t(\vec{p},\,\vec{v},\,\vec{w}),\, 0),\, 1)\;(\vec{w} - \vec{v})\right) - \vec{p}\|
\end{equation}

We then define a ``squared distance'' from the poly-line $A$ (containing $n$ vertices) to the poly-line $B$ (containing $m$ vertices):

\begin{equation}
D(A,\,B) \equiv \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \mathrm{min}\{j \in \mathbb{N}_0,\, j < m;\; d(A_i,\, B_j,\, B_{j+1})^2\}.
\end{equation}

The choice to square the distances and penalize large deviations from other lines was a data-driven choice to improve the results of clustering.

Finally, we define our separation measure between two drawn poly-lines as

\begin{equation}
distance(A,\,B) \equiv D(A,\,B) + D(B,\,A).
\end{equation}
