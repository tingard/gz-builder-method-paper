In this Section we explore the consistency with which volunteers modelled galaxies, the variance of the aggregate model recovered and how well our recovered models agree with other results in the literature.


\subsection{Examination of Volunteer consistency}
Figure \ref{fig:volunteer_component_consistency} illustrates the consistency with which volunteers made use of a component in their model for a galaxy. We see that volunteer classification is quite consistent, with volunteers almost always using a disc and bulge, and consistent proportions agreeing on the presence of a bar and the number of spiral arms.

  \caption{Comparison of frequency of use of component in volunteer models between the original and validation sets of classifications.}
  \label{fig:volunteer_component_consistency}
\end{figure*}

We see some consistency in isophotal shape and size, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:aggregate_model_consistency}. The least consistent component is the bar. This may be due to the low proportion of volunteers incorporating one into their model (as illustrated in Figure. \ref{fig:volunteer_component_consistency}, visual inspection suggests that many volunteers used a very elliptical bulge and drawn spirals to capture the light from the bar). Fewer bars drawn by volunteers also has the effect of making clustering more difficult and more uncertain, even for a strongly barred galaxy we effectively go from receiving 30 classifications to around 12.

% We also combine classifications from the original and validation subsets and repeatedly draw 30 classifications from the pool to calculate an aggregate model and examine the variation in calculated models. Figure \ref{fig:aggregate_model_ss_variance} illustrates the consistency of components in models; we

Given a pool of 60 classifications for a galaxy, we repeatedly sample 30 classifications and calculate an aggregate model. We then obtain a fraction of these models containing each available component, which has been histogrammed. If our models were perfectly resilient (i.e. consistent components regardless of sampled classification), we would see two peaks at 0.0 and 1.0; the presence of galaxies with intermediate fractions suggests that the presence of a component in our model has some uncertainty.}

\subsection{Comparison to results in the literature}
\subsubsection{Aggregated Disk, Bulge and Bar}
After having obtained aggregated models for our galaxies, we examine the reliability of our models through comparison to other results in the literature. For instance, if we compare the axis ratios of the discs recovered from Galaxy Builder to the axis ratio of a 2D S\'ersic fit to the r-band SDSS image of each galaxy (as provided in the NASA-Sloan Atlas), we see excellent agreement (Figure \ref{fig:ax_ratio_comparison}). We note that the results from Galaxy Builder tend to prefer a slightly more elliptical axis ratio, but plateau at an axis ratio of $0.5$. This could be due to the drawing tool ellipse having a default axis ratio of $0.5$, and biasing volunteer classification or aggregate shapes. Alternatively, this observed effect could reflect a valid observation of volunteers - for instance that discs are more rounded closer to their centres.

  \caption{Comparison between the axis ratios of the disc components of aggregated Galaxy Builder models to the results of an r-band S\'ersic profile fit.}
  \label{fig:ax_ratio_comparison}
\end{figure}

We also make comparisons to existing measures of morphology for individual galaxies: When comparing the probability of a classification containing a bar component against a galaxy being classed as strongly-barred or as having no bar (as defined in \citealt{Masters2010:1003.0449v2}), we see a significant difference: classifications of strongly-barred galaxies ($p_\text{bar} > 0.5$) had a \comment{$0.57 \pm 0.16$} chance of containing a bar, vs \comment{$0.37 \pm 0.12$} for galaxies classed as having no bar ($p_\text{bar} < 0.2$). The Spearman correlation between GZ2's $p_\text{bar}$ and the bar likelihood in Galaxy Builder is \comment{$0.75$}, which implies a notable correlation.

\comment{Brooke - Are fits to your galaxies also in Simard et al. (2011), Meert et al, Lackner and Gunn? It would be good to compare to multiple different studies, and since many of them didn’t fit spiral arms or bars it’s a good opportunity to test the effect of adding those components.}

\subsubsection{Aggregated Spiral Arms}
In order to benchmark the reliability of this method of spiral parameter extraction, we compare the result of our logarithmic spiral fit to the relationship obtained by \citet{Hart2016:1607.01019v1} between GZ2 classification and galaxy pitch angle (Figure \ref{fig:hart_pitch_angle}). Their fit was obtained by using the Zooniverse to filter good vs bad spiral arm segments identified using a leading automated spiral arm detection and fitting tool, \textsc{SpArcFiRe} \citep{Davis2014:1402.1910v1}. We find good agreement, although there are large error bars on the GZ2-produced pitch angle (and a caveat in the paper that these pitch angles should not be used for individual galaxies).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images__results/pitch-angle-comparison.pdf}
  \caption{A comparison of Pitch angle obtained by \citet{Hart2016:1607.01019v1} with measured pitch angles for the aggregated model results in galaxies in the Galaxy Zoo Builder sample. Errors on the Galaxy Builder pitch angles come from dispersion in the arms drawn by volunteers.}
  \label{fig:hart_pitch_angle}
\end{figure}

% We can also directly compare the pitch angles from Galaxy Builder models to the output of the SpArcFiRe software, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sparcfire_pitch_angle}. The SpArcFiRe pitch angle used is the length-weighted mean of all arms of the dominant chirality of a galaxy. In this plot, unlike Figure \ref{fig:hart_pitch_angle}, errors are the sample error of arms used in the averaging and is a measure of inter-arm variation pitch angle.

\subsubsection{Comparison to Photometric Fits}
In this Section we make comparisons between Galaxy Builder models and the result of many-component photometric fits. \citet{Kruk2017:1710.00093v2} performed many-component, multi-band decompositions of a selection of Sloan galaxies, 12 of which were also classified in Galaxy Builder. For each of these galaxies we obtain the ``best'' model provided by volunteers (scored using mean squared error, in units of nanomaggies) and futher optimize the slider parameters available to volunteers, as well as the effective radius and axis ratio of all components. Figure \ref{fig:sd_comp_comparison} compares the axis ratios and effective radii of bulges, discs and bars in \citet{Kruk2017:1710.00093v2} to those produced here.

\comment{Brooke - I think there's something important missing from this paper: the extent to which using volunteer contributions captures the true set of uncertainties in parametric fitting. Galfit reports formal uncertainties that are very small compared to the true uncertainties. (Chien is the first and loudest person to say this but still people only quote the galfit uncertainties without ever even noting they are only reporting the smallest term.) Studies like Haussler et al. (2007)\footnote{\url{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..172..615H/abstract}} and Simmons \& Urry (2008)\footnote{\url{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...683..644S/abstract}} show this in various ways, so this is a known effect that isn’t usually measured for a sample because it’s a ton of work and computing time. GIM2D apparently measures a full set of posteriors, or likelihoods, can’t recall which, but again, it’s not that easy to use that software (by design, because Luc Simard didn’t want it to be a black box) so it’s not as popular as galfit, and there are newer codes like ProFit that do it but they haven’t really taken off yet — and none of these have the advantage of having human eyes on the data. I think this is a unique space and you can potentially make the point that you naturally measure this and thus draw primarily from the advantages of all methods here.

I think this should lean in a little more to the spread in classifiers' fit parameters and explore what that means for a galaxy and whether 30 classifications per galaxy is enough to characterise the uncertainty in the fits
