In this paper we present a novel method for modelling of galaxy images, \textit{Galaxy Builder}\footnote{\url{https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tingard/galaxy-builder/}}, which was conceived with the goal of solving the ``quality of quantity" dilema facing galaxy image modelling, which, despite advances in computation, still typically requires significant human interaction to achieve quality fits.

\textit{Galaxy Builder} leverages the power of crowd sourcing for the hardest to automate parts of image fitting, namely determining the appropriate number of model components to include, and finding parameters which are close to the global optima.

We have demonstrated that we are able to obtain models with residuals at the level of (PUT NUMBERS HERE?) from volunteer classifications, using both the best individual classification and an aggregate model from clustering.

We compare these new models to existing results in the literature where available. We find good agreement where the models or parameters are similar, and comment on instances where \textit{Galaxy Builder} should provide superior models.

\comment{Add more numbers here}

While we were able to obtain models for 296 images in a period of XX Months of running the site, we note that user experience will need to be considered if significantly larger numbers of these models are to be obtained.

We are optimistic about the potential of projects like \textit{Galaxy Builder} to dramatically increase the ability of researchers to perform complex, labour-intensive modelling of galaxy photometry, leveraging the power of the crowd to perform the complex tasks best suited to humans, and computer algorithms for the final optimization.

We elease our catalogue of models to the community, and in future work we use this sample to investigate spiral arm formation mechanisms (T. Lingard et al. in prep.).
