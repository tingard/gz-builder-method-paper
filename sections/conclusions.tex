This paper has explored how citizen science could impact the problem of photometric modelling of spiral galaxies using complex models. We have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain models which generally show good agreement with existing results in the literature. However, it is also apparent that the recovered models are very dependent on the quality of classifications received, and as such show potentially large internal variance.

The complexity of the tasks involved in this project coupled with the difficulties in clustering and aggregating data suggest that this is one problem space the power of the crowd hasn't quite overcome yet. Despite this, we remain of the opinion that better user experience design \& in-browser computer optimization will help improve the quality of classifications and thus that of the recovered models.
